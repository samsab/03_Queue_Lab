//Syntax note: This uses the pre-processor to create a constant
// You could also use "const static" to make a constant, as in Java.

// place that the pre-processor sees "START_SIZE" it will replace it with
// 10 ... so this is like a global "find and replace".
#define START_SIZE 10

//Syntax note: C++ is not very good at figuring out which methods belong
// to which classes. That is why we have to use the scope operator to
// tell the compiler that this ArrayQueue() method belongs to the
// ArrayQueue<T> class.
